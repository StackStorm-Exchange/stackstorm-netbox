## 1.0.0

- Added script in `/bin` to auto generate all action meta definitions based on the NetBox OpenAPI (Swagger) spec.
- All actions rewritten (auto generated) based on the new mechanism. Note existing actions have been renamed (see Breaking changes)
- New actions generated to cover all routes available in the NetBox 2.4 API.

### Breaking changes
- All pre-existing actions have been renamed to conform to a new, consistent naming scheme. That scheme is `<http_verb>.<app>.<route>`

## 0.5.0
- Added proper application/json Content-Type header to all requests

## 0.4.2
- Changed the `id` parameter on `ipam_post_available_ips` to `prefix_id` so it does not auto convert to a detail route

## 0.4.1
- Fixed `ipam_post_available_ips` to use correct parameters

## 0.4.0
- Added support for virtualization enpoints
  - GET: clusters, cluster groups, cluster types, virtual machine interfaces, virtual machines
  - POST, PUT, PATCH: virtual machines, virtual machine interfaces
- Added support for converting to the detail route by passing the `id` parameter on all applicable endpoints. This converts the api route to `<endpoint_uri>/<id>/` which will always return a max of one entity, instead of a list of zero or more entities.

## 0.3.2
- Added new action for getting device interface connections.

## 0.3.0
- Added ability to save results into st2 key/value store. Useful when the result from Netbox is very large and will be piped to another action.

- Added action to get available IPs from a prefix
- Refactored action.py to allow for POST requests as well as GET
